This repository contains 3 scripts for setting up a new Mac:
- `bashprofile`: Sets up a bash profile with my preferred aliases and functions
- `installapps`: Installs various apps that I use for iOS development and related tasks
- `systempreferences`: Updates various macOS settings to my preferred options
